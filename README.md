Secure+Safe is a lightweight, modular C++ application designed as a cybersecurity utility. It includes essential tools to help users generate secure passwords, evaluate password strength, encrypt/decrypt data, and simulate a basic login system with encrypted file-based storage.

This project was created as a final assignment for a C++ programming course and demonstrates modular design, file handling, input validation, and user-defined functions.
